extraction_task:
  description: >
    Meticulously extract and classify all relevant entities into the most appropriate and specific category from the provided neuroscience text. 
       The list of entities extracted should be exhaustive and comprehensive. You should identify and label all entities, including duplicates.                                                             
       Please ensure that all entities are accurately identified and classified according to their role within the neuroscience domain. 
       IMPORTANT: DO NOT modify the input text in any way. Use the text as is, without any alterations or corrections. 
    
    
     Instructions: 
    
         NER Extractions instructions:
             - Read the input {literature} carefully by paragraph. Split into small paragraph chunks as necessary.
             - Read the entire paper thoroughly, analyzing sentence by sentence.
             - Do not skip over large sections of text—ensure full coverage of all paragraphs and sections (e.g., abstract, methods, results).
             - If only a few entities are detected from a large block of text, reassess your extraction to avoid missing relevant entities.
             - Identify and extract all the named entities relevant to neuroscience.
             - A named entity is anything that can be referred to with a proper name.
             - Examples of neuroscience related named entities include the following:
                 - Animal species (e.g., mouse, drosophila, zebrafish)
                 - Brain or anatomical regions (e.g., neocortex, mushroom body, cerebellum)
                 - Experimental conditions (e.g., control, tetrodotoxin treatment, Scn1a knockout)
                 - Cell types (e.g., pyramidal neuron, direction-sensitive mechanoreceptor, oligodendrocyte)
             - Ensure each extracted entity is clearly labeled with its entity type (e.g., species, region, condition, cell type).
             - If you are unsure about a term, include it with a flag for review (e.g., "uncertain").
             - If there are multiple sentences that refer to the same entity extract all the sentences, the start end index and make it as a list in the output.
      Important
        - Minimum numbers should be at least 100 entities for large text. 
       paper_metadata_consistency_check: 
          Ensure all entity entries in the output include consistent and correct metadata:
            - Each entity must have a valid `paper_title` and `doi` field.
            - If multiple entities come from the same paper, the values of `paper_title` and `doi` must be identical across those entities.
            - If a value is missing, check the other entries or the original context and fill it in accordingly.
            - Do not leave `paper_title` or `doi` blank unless all entries are truly missing that information.
            - Avoid using placeholder values like "Check for updates" as `paper_title`.
      
        rules:
          - paper_title: must be a non-empty string (not a list)
          - doi: must be a string, may be empty only if genuinely unavailable for all entries
          - values should be normalized across entries from the same source
          - if any entity has these fields filled, others from the same paper must have matching values
      
        failure_modes_to_fix:
          - One entity has `doi` and `paper_title` while others do not
          - One entity has placeholder `paper_title`, like "Check for updates", while others are correct
          - One entry has a `doi` but another from the same paper has an empty string
    output_requirements:
                         - The output must be a **single JSON object**

                         - Second-level keys must be **stringified integers**: "1", "2", ...

  description: >
    Perform concept alignment on the extracted structured information by mapping each entity 
    to a matching concept (class) from a given ontology or schema.
    
    Inputs: {extracted_structured_information}
    
    Instructions:
      alignment instructions:
        - For each entity in `extracted_structured_information`, find the most appropriate matching concept from an ontology or schema.
        - Concept alignment means associating a term with a known ontological class or identifier (e.g., from CL, UBERON, NCBITaxon, etc.).
        - Use a local knowledge source or indexed search system to retrieve candidate concepts (labels or IDs) where possible and marked in remarks if local knowledge source is used.
        - Record the matched ontology information for each term:
            - Ontology label (e.g., "hippocampus")
            - Ontology ID (e.g., "UBERON:0001950")
        - Add a `remarks` for each alignment, noting whether:
            - The alignment was made using a successful match from the local knowledge source.
            - Or the alignment was inferred without a direct match.
        - Do not remove or overwrite any previous remarks; always append new remarks.
    
      User Feedback Handling:
        If the input includes modifications made based on human/user feedback:
        Detect and respect these changes (e.g., altered extracted terms).
        Do not overwrite user-modified terms.
        Instead, annotate in remarks that user-defined values were retained and evaluated accordingly.
    
      failure_modes_to_fix:
          - "Inconsistent `ontology_id`/`ontology_label` across same entity."

      Judgement:
        - Analyze the content of {aligned_structured_information} and evaluate how well the extracted information aligns with the target ontology or schema.

  description: >
    Input: {judged_structured_information_with_human_feedback}

    Objective: Evaluate and, if necessary, revise the structured output to ensure accurate alignment with the target ontology/schema.

    Important: The number of extracted entities should not be less than what you received.
    modification_context: 
      {modification_context}
    
    user_feedback_text:
      {user_feedback_text}
    
    Instructions:

    Alignment Assessment:
      Analyze {judged_structured_information_with_human_feedback} to determine whether the extracted terms and structures are correctly aligned with the intended ontology or schema.

    
    update_handling:
          - "Preserve existing remarks."
          - "Append new remark for each change made."
          - "Indicate knowledge source or user evidence behind updates in remarks."

    Provenance-Aware Remarking:
      Update the remarks field as follows:
      Append a new remark describing the updates made (e.g., corrected label, updated score).
      Specify if the update was informed by a knowledge source or prior evidence.
      Do not remove existing remarks—always preserve historical annotations.

    User Feedback Handling:
      If the input includes modifications made based on human/user feedback:
      Detect and respect these changes (e.g., altered extracted terms).
      Do not overwrite user-modified terms.
      Instead, annotate in remarks that user-defined values were retained and evaluated accordingly.
    
    failure_modes_to_fix:
      - "Judge score conflicts (e.g., 1.0 score for low-quality match)."
      - "Misaligned paper metadata across multiple entries."
      - "Missing or conflicting ontology IDs for same entity."
      - "Field arrays of unequal length."

    Constraints:
      Preserve all historical data (especially remarks).
      Ensure outputs are traceable, auditable, and schema-compliant.
    
    output_requirements:
                   - The output must be a **single JSON object**
