However, the mechanisms by which these exposures interact with brain functional connectivity and in uence behavior remain unexplored. METHODS: We investigated the comprehensive environment-brain-behavior triple interactions through rigorous association, prediction, and mediation analyses, while adjusting for multiple confounders. Particularly, we examined the predictive power of brain functional network connectivity (FNC) and 41 environmental exposures for 23 behaviors related to cognitive ability and mental health in 7655 children selected from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study at both baseline and follow-up. RESULTS: FNC demonstrated more predictability for cognitive abilities than for mental health, with cross-validation from the UK Biobank study (N = 20,852), highlighting the importance of thalamus and hippocampus in longitudinal prediction, while FNC1environment demonstrated more predictive power than FNC in both cross-sectional and longitudinal prediction of all behaviors, especially for mental health (r = 0.32–0.63). We found that family and neighborhood exposures were common critical environmental in uencers on cognitive ability and mental health, which can be mediated by FNC signi cantly. Healthy perinatal development was a unique protective factor for higher cognitive ability, whereas sleep problems, family con icts, and adverse school environments speci cally increased risk of poor mental health. CONCLUSIONS: This work revealed comprehensive environment-brain-behavior triple interactions based on the ABCD Study, identi ed cognitive control and default mode networks as the most predictive functional networks for a wide repertoire of behaviors, and underscored the long-lasting impact of critical environmental exposures on childhood development, in which sleep problems were the most prominent factors affecting mental health. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2023.12.019 Adolescence has long been known as an important time for developing cognitive skills and is also a period when most mental disorders initially manifest (1). Moreover, a child’s brain undergoes a growth spurt in structural and functional matu- ration, building a foundation for behavioral outcomes (2). Despite the well-known fact that environmental exposures play a critical role in in uencing behaviors, we have a very limited understanding of how these exposures interact with the brain and in turn shape our behaviors, especially during adolescence (3). Recent years have seen rapid growth of interest in exam- ining the neural basis through which environmental exposures can have enduring effects on behaviors (4–6). Nevertheless, research in this context has been dominated by brain structural features in children (4,7), with less focus on brain functional measures. This is partly due to the easier access and feasibility of structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, though functional features have shown more predictive power for high-order cognition (8). As a measure that can well charac- terize individual variability (9,10), functional network connectivity (FNC) quanti es the temporal statistical de- pendencies between functional activation among different brain networks, providing insightful correlations between het- erogeneous personal behaviors with the brain (11). The limited evidence available on relationships between brain, environ- ment, and behaviors (5,12) calls for a more comprehensive investigation into how different brain functional networks may connect or even mediate associations between diverse envi- ronmental exposures and a wide range of childhood behaviors. Furthermore, previous environment-behavior association studies often focused on a single behavioral domain (e.g., cognitive ability) or only a few environmental domains (4,6,13), thus not capturing the broader relationships between various factors. For example, suf cient sleep (14) and high socioeco- nomic status (4) may improve cognitive ability, while long-term exposure to air pollution (15) and low family income (5) can have the opposite impact. Perinatal factors such as birth weight and postnatal growth have been associated with cognitive ability but not mental health (16), whereas higher community noise impaired both (17).

However, the mechanisms by which these exposures interact with brain functional connectivity and in uence behavior remain unexplored. METHODS: We investigated the comprehensive environment-brain-behavior triple interactions through rigorous association, prediction, and mediation analyses, while adjusting for multiple confounders. Particularly, we examined the predictive power of brain functional network connectivity (FNC) and 41 environmental exposures for 23 behaviors related to cognitive ability and mental health in 7655 children selected from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study at both baseline and follow-up. RESULTS: FNC demonstrated more predictability for cognitive abilities than for mental health, with cross-validation from the UK Biobank study (N = 20,852), highlighting the importance of thalamus and hippocampus in longitudinal prediction, while FNC1environment demonstrated more predictive power than FNC in both cross-sectional and longitudinal prediction of all behaviors, especially for mental health (r = 0.32–0.63). We found that family and neighborhood exposures were common critical environmental in uencers on cognitive ability and mental health, which can be mediated by FNC signi cantly. Healthy perinatal development was a unique protective factor for higher cognitive ability, whereas sleep problems, family con icts, and adverse school environments speci cally increased risk of poor mental health. CONCLUSIONS: This work revealed comprehensive environment-brain-behavior triple interactions based on the ABCD Study, identi ed cognitive control and default mode networks as the most predictive functional networks for a wide repertoire of behaviors, and underscored the long-lasting impact of critical environmental exposures on childhood development, in which sleep problems were the most prominent factors affecting mental health. https:/doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2023.12.019 Adolescence has long been known as an important time for developing cognitive skills and is also a period when most mental disorders initially manifest (1).

However, the mechanisms by which these exposures interact with brain functional connectivity and in uence behavior remain unexplored. METHODS: We investigated the comprehensive environment-brain-behavior triple interactions through rigorous association, prediction, and mediation analyses, while adjusting for multiple confounders. Particularly, we examined the predictive power of brain functional network connectivity (FNC) and 41 environmental exposures for 23 behaviors related to cognitive ability and mental health in 7655 children selected from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study at both baseline and follow-up. RESULTS: FNC demonstrated more predictability for cognitive abilities than for mental health, with cross-validation from the UK Biobank study (N = 20,852), highlighting the importance of thalamus and hippocampus in longitudinal prediction, while FNC1environment demonstrated more predictive power than FNC in both cross-sectional and longitudinal prediction of all behaviors, especially for mental health (r = 0.32–0.63). We found that family and neighborhood exposures were common critical environmental in uencers on cognitive ability and mental health, which can be mediated by FNC signi cantly. Healthy perinatal development was a unique protective factor for higher cognitive ability, whereas sleep problems, family con icts, and adverse school environments speci cally increased risk of poor mental health. CONCLUSIONS: This work revealed comprehensive environment-brain-behavior triple interactions based on the ABCD Study, identi ed cognitive control and default mode networks as the most predictive functional networks for a wide repertoire of behaviors, and underscored the long-lasting impact of critical environmental exposures on childhood development, in which sleep problems were the most prominent factors affecting mental health. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2023.12.019 Adolescence has long been known as an important time for developing cognitive skills and is also a period when most mental disorders initially manifest (1). Moreover, a child’s brain undergoes a growth spurt in structural and functional matu- ration, building a foundation for behavioral outcomes (2). Despite the well-known fact that environmental exposures play a critical role in in uencing behaviors, we have a very limited understanding of how these exposures interact with the brain and in turn shape our behaviors, especially during adolescence (3). Recent years have seen rapid growth of interest in exam- ining the neural basis through which environmental exposures can have enduring effects on behaviors (4–6). Nevertheless, research in this context has been dominated by brain structural features in children (4,7), with less focus on brain functional measures. This is partly due to the easier access and feasibility of structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, though functional features have shown more predictive power for high-order cognition (8). As a measure that can well charac- terize individual variability (9,10), functional network connectivity (FNC) quanti es the temporal statistical de- pendencies between functional activation among different brain networks, providing insightful correlations between het- erogeneous personal behaviors with the brain (11). The limited evidence available on relationships between brain, environ- ment, and behaviors (5,12) calls for a more comprehensive investigation into how different brain functional networks may connect or even mediate associations between diverse envi- ronmental exposures and a wide range of childhood behaviors. Furthermore, previous environment-behavior association studies often focused on a single behavioral domain (e.g., cognitive ability) or only a few environmental domains (4,6,13), thus not capturing the broader relationships between various factors. For example, suf cient sleep (14) and high socioeco- nomic status (4) may improve cognitive ability, while long-term exposure to air pollution (15) and low family income (5) can have the opposite impact. Perinatal factors such as birth weight and postnatal growth have been associated with cognitive ability but not mental health (16), whereas higher community noise impaired both (17).

However, the mechanisms by which these exposures interact with brain functional connectivity and in uence behavior remain unexplored. METHODS: We investigated the comprehensive environment-brain-behavior triple interactions through rigorous association, prediction, and mediation analyses, while adjusting for multiple confounders. Particularly, we examined the predictive power of brain functional network connectivity (FNC) and 41 environmental exposures for 23 behaviors related to cognitive ability and mental health in 7655 children selected from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study at both baseline and follow-up. RESULTS: FNC demonstrated more predictability for cognitive abilities than for mental health, with cross-validation from the UK Biobank study (N = 20,852), highlighting the importance of thalamus and hippocampus in longitudinal prediction, while FNC1environment demonstrated more predictive power than FNC in both cross-sectional and longitudinal prediction of all behaviors, especially for mental health (r = 0.32–0.63). We found that family and neighborhood exposures were common critical environmental in uencers on cognitive ability and mental health, which can be mediated by FNC signi cantly. Healthy perinatal development was a unique protective factor for higher cognitive ability, whereas sleep problems, family con icts, and adverse school environments speci cally increased risk of poor mental health. CONCLUSIONS: This work revealed comprehensive environment-brain-behavior triple interactions based on the ABCD Study, identi ed cognitive control and default mode networks as the most predictive functional networks for a wide repertoire of behaviors, and underscored the long-lasting impact of critical environmental exposures on childhood development, in which sleep problems were the most prominent factors affecting mental health. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2023.12.019 Adolescence has long been known as an important time for developing cognitive skills and is also a period when most mental disorders initially manifest (1). Moreover, a child’s brain undergoes a growth spurt in structural and functional matu- ration, building a foundation for behavioral outcomes (2). Despite the well-known fact that environmental exposures play a critical role in in uencing behaviors, we have a very limited understanding of how these exposures interact with the brain and in turn shape our behaviors, especially during adolescence (3). Recent years have seen rapid growth of interest in exam- ining the neural basis through which environmental exposures can have enduring effects on behaviors (4–6). Nevertheless, research in this context has been dominated by brain structural features in children (4,7), with less focus on brain functional measures. This is partly due to the easier access and feasibility of structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, though functional features have shown more predictive power for high-order cognition (8). As a measure that can well charac- terize individual variability (9,10), functional network connectivity (FNC) quanti es the temporal statistical de- pendencies between functional activation among different brain networks, providing insightful correlations between het- erogeneous personal behaviors with the brain (11). The limited evidence available on relationships between brain, environ- ment, and behaviors (5,12) calls for a more comprehensive investigation into how different brain functional networks may connect or even mediate associations between diverse envi- ronmental exposures and a wide range of childhood behaviors. Furthermore, previous environment-behavior association studies often focused on a single behavioral domain (e.g., cognitive ability) or only a few environmental domains (4,6,13), thus not capturing the broader relationships between various factors. For example, suf cient sleep (14) and high socioeco- nomic status (4) may improve cognitive ability, while long-term exposure to air pollution (15) and low family income (5) can have the opposite impact. Perinatal factors such as birth weight and postnatal growth have been associated with cognitive ability but not mental health (16), whereas higher community noise impaired both (17). Additionally,\""
