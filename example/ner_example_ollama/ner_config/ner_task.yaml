extraction_task:
  description: >
    From the given literature extract named entities from neuroscience statements. 
    A named entity is anything that can be referred to with a proper name. 
    Some common named entities in neuroscience articles are animal species (e.g., mouse, drosophila, zebrafish), anatomical regions (e.g., neocortex, mushroom body, cerebellum), experimental conditions (e.g., control, tetrodotoxin treatment, Scn1a knockout), and cell types (e.g., pyramidal neuron, direction-sensitive mechanoreceptor, oligodendrocyte)

alignment_task:
  description: >
    Take the output of extractor_agent {extracted_structured_information} as input and perform the concept alignment using the ontological concepts. 
    A concept alignment is anything where you align the given entity to the matching concept aka class from a ontology or a schema.

  description: >
    Take the output of alignment agent {aligned_structured_information} as input and perform the following evaluation: 
    1. Assess the quality and accuracy of the alignment with the ontology or schema in {aligned_structured_information}.
    2. Assign a score between 0 and 1 as a judge_score.
    3. Update the {aligned_structured_information} adding the judge_score.
